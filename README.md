### Amazon Product Review Analysis – Key Insights

1. Discount Strategy Drives Engagement:

  - Categories with higher average discounts tend to attract more reviews and engagement.

  - However, excessive discounts don’t always translate to higher ratings, indicating price isn’t the only factor influencing satisfaction.

2. Top-Performing Categories:

  - Certain categories (e.g., electronics or personal care) generated significantly higher potential revenue, showing where Amazon could double down on marketing and inventory.

3. High-Performing Products:

  - A few standout products had both high ratings and high review counts, making them ideal for upselling, bundling, or featuring in recommendations.

4. Ratings Are Clustered:

  - The majority of products are rated between 3.5 to 4.5, suggesting generally favorable satisfaction but also leaving room for improvement in product quality or descriptions.

5. Revenue Opportunity:

  - By calculating potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count), we see the highest-earning categories aren’t always the most discounted indicating that product value and category popularity also drive revenue.

6. User Trust Signals:

  - The top 5 products (combined highest ratings and review counts) serve as trust anchors for their categories and can be leveraged in promotions.
